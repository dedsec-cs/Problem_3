**AI-Powered Smart Survey Tool for Survey Data Collection**

1. **Track:**  
   Data Collection  

2. **Description:**  
   The National Sample Survey (NSS), managed by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), collects comprehensive socio-economic data from households and businesses. Traditional enumerator-driven survey methods face challenges due to India’s linguistic diversity and logistical complexities. With the widespread adoption of smartphones, AI, and platforms like WhatsApp, there is an opportunity to modernize official surveys. The objective is to develop an AI-enabled tool that enhances the efficiency, inclusivity, and intelligence of data collection to meet the evolving needs of national statistical systems.

3. **Expected Outcomes/Solutions:**  
   Participants are expected to deliver:  
   - A functional prototype of an AI-powered smart survey tool (web, mobile, or hybrid).  
   - A no-code or prompt-based survey builder with a standardized question bank.  
   - Support for multiple survey delivery channels, including WhatsApp, phone calls, and AI avatar interfaces.  
   - Prepopulation of data using unique identifiers, with multilingual and voice-based interfaces.  
   - AI-driven adaptive questioning and real-time response validation.  
   - Capture of paradata (e.g., time, location, device, mode) and quality flagging.  
   - Automatic coding of responses and storage in structured formats.  
   - A dashboard to monitor enumerator performance and data quality.  
   - Comprehensive code, documentation, and a concise implementation summary.

4. **Relevance to National Priorities or Ongoing MoSPI Initiatives:**  
   This initiative aligns with MoSPI’s digital transformation agenda, particularly through its Data Innovation Lab. MoSPI aims to modernize data collection by integrating automation, AI, and new technologies. The project supports upcoming large-scale surveys, such as the Economic Census, and contributes to building a national "Statistics-as-a-Service" (StaaS) architecture, strengthening India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for data.

5. **Background Resources or Datasets:**  
   Participants may access the following:  
   - Sample survey questionnaires from previous NSS rounds.  
   - Local Government Directory (LGD) codes for location mapping and geo-coding.  
   - Open datasets for prepopulation logic (e.g., Census, SECC, socio-economic indicators).  
   - MoSPI metadata standards and classification codes (e.g., NCO, NIC, ISIC).

6. **Key Features Required:**  

   - **Survey Creation:**  
     - A no-code interface for building surveys.  
     - Survey form generation using natural language prompts.  
     - Access to a standardized question bank or library.  
     - Support for conditional logic, loops, and skip patterns.  

   - **Data Prepopulation:**  
     - Use of unique identifiers (e.g., household ID, Aadhaar, phone number) to pre-fill known data fields.  

   - **AI-Driven Adaptive Questioning:**  
     - Automatic inference of respondent traits for personalized follow-up questions.  
     - Dynamic routing using lightweight large language models (LLMs) or rules-based classifiers.  

   - **Multilingual and Multi-Modal Interface:**  
     - Language selection with automated translation at survey start.  
     - Support for surveys via WhatsApp, IVR/phone, and AI avatar chat interfaces.  

   - **Real-Time Validation and Auto-Coding:**  
     - Built-in rules and AI to detect inconsistent responses.  
     - Automatic coding of text and categorical responses using standard classifications.  
     - Storage in structured databases (SQL/NoSQL).  

   - **Monitoring and Quality Dashboard:**  
     - Dashboards for supervisors to track progress, quality, and enumerator performance.  

   - **Data Privacy, Security, and Consent:**  
     - **Consent Management:** Clear, auditable mechanisms to capture and manage respondent consent at survey start.  
     - **Data Security:** Encryption of data in transit and at rest, with secure data handling practices.  
     - **Privacy by Design:** Adherence to principles of data minimization and purpose limitation.

7. **Paradata & Quality Assurance:**  
   The tool must collect paradata to ensure high-quality data collection, including:  
   - Time spent on each question or module.  
   - Start/end timestamps and pauses.  
   - GPS coordinates and survey location.  
   - Device type and interview mode.  
   - Patterns in enumerator behavior.  
   - AI-based flags for poor-quality or suspicious entries.

8. **Bonus Features / Future Scope:**  
   Teams are encouraged to innovate with additional features, such as:  
   - An integrated chatbot for self-service enumeration.  
   - Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for document scanning.  
   - Lightweight real-time analytics and visualizations.  
   - Biometric or facial recognition for respondent verification.  
   - AI-based summarization or classification of open-ended responses.  
   - Offline survey capabilities.

9. **Impact Potential:**  
   This tool could serve as a foundation for AI-driven data collection platforms across sectors like health, education, labor, agriculture, and governance. It has the potential to transform how official data is collected, validated, and utilized in real time, making the process more inclusive and respondent-friendly. The initiative supports India’s vision of building scalable, trusted, and intelligent Digital Public Infrastructure for data.
