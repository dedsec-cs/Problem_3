## **2. 3-Week MVP Sprint Plan**

### **Week 1 â€“ Skeleton & Core Setup**

**Frontend**

- React + Tailwind setup
    
- Page routing (Login, Chat, Dashboard)
    
- Basic UI layout
    

**Backend**

- Node.js + Express setup
    
- MongoDB Atlas connection
    
- Auth endpoints done (register, login, JWT middleware)
    

**Milestone:** Auth module working E2E (login â†’ dashboard redirect)

---

### **Week 2 â€“ Core Features Integration**

**Frontend**

- Chat UI component linked to backend
    
- File upload UI for OCR
    
- Placeholder charts with dummy data
    

**Backend**

- AI Chat endpoint integrated with OpenAI API
    
- OCR endpoint functional with Tesseract.js
    
- Dashboard API to serve processed data
    

**Milestone:** Chat, file upload, and dashboard pages fetch live backend data

---

### **Week 3 â€“ MVP Completion & First Demo**

**Frontend**

- Polish UI with ShadCN/UI components
    
- Make dashboard charts interactive
    
- Implement basic filtering
    

**Backend**

- Store extracted text in MongoDB
    
- Return stored data for dashboard queries
    
- Add error handling + basic logging
    

**Milestone:** **Full MVP ready** â€” Auth â†’ Chat â†’ Data extraction â†’ Dashboard works end-to-end

---

## **3. Division of Labor (First 3 Weeks)**

**You (Lead Dev)** â€“ Backend architecture, AI Chat integration, OCR backend  
**Person 2** â€“ Frontend skeleton, Chat UI, integration with backend  
**Person 3** â€“ Auth backend + frontend forms, MongoDB schema setup  
**Person 4** â€“ Dashboard backend APIs, Chart.js visualizations  
**Person 5** â€“ Testing each module as itâ€™s built, dummy data creation, slide prep

---

## **4. Parallel Work Streams**

Weâ€™ll keep **frontend & backend completely separate** until Week 2 mid-point.  
This means:

- Frontend team uses dummy JSON for UI
    
- Backend team uses Postman to test APIs
    
- Merge only after both are stable
    

---

## **5. MVP Demo Strategy**

- Show **end-to-end flow** in under 3 minutes
    
- Avoid live coding â€” run a **pre-filled demo**
    
- Keep backup screenshots in case internet fails
    
- Make sure at least 3 team members can run the demo locally
    

---
Now We Have:-
- Locked MVP features
- 3-week timeline with milestones
- Role assignments for MVP
- Parallel work method to avoid merge chaos
- Demo plan for early validation
