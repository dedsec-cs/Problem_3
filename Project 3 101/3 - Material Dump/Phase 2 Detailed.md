# Phase 2 â€“ Deep Analysis

### **ðŸŽ¯ Goal:**

### **Step 1 â€“ Risk & Feasibility Check**

We rank each core use case based on **Effort (E)** and **Impact (I)**.

- Effort: 1 = Easy, 5 = Nightmare    
- Impact: 1 = Low impact, 5 = Game-changer

| Use Case               | Effort | Impact | Priority |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| AI Chat Assistant      | 3      | 5      | High     |
| Smart Data Extraction  | 4      | 5      | High     |
| Analytics Dashboard    | 2      | 4      | Medium   |
| User Account System    | 2      | 3      | Medium   |
| Voice Command Support* | 4      | 3      | Low      |
| Emotion-Based UI*      | 4      | 2      | Low      |

### **Step 2 â€“ Dependencies Mapping**

This helps avoid building features in the wrong order.

**Dependency Chain:**

1. **User Account System** â†’ Required if we want personalization/saved history.
2. **AI Chat Assistant** â†’ Needs backend + API integration.
3. **Smart Data Extraction** â†’ Can be standalone or integrate into the chat assistant.
4. **Analytics Dashboard** â†’ Needs processed data from extraction or chat logs.
5. Optional features â†’ Only start after Core MVP is stable.

### **Step 3 â€“ Success Criteria (Definition of Done)**

- **AI Chat Assistant:** Responds to at least 5 predefined query types + 1 API call (e.g., weather, jokes, summaries).
- **Smart Data Extraction:** Extracts text from at least 2 formats (PDF, Image) with >80% accuracy.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Displays charts/tables from extracted data without manual refresh.
- **User Account System:** Users can sign up, log in, and see saved history.

### **Step 4 â€“ Kill / Postpone Risky Features**

- **Voice Command Support** â†’ High effort, low scoring on judge wow-factor unless perfect. Postpone.
- **Emotion-Based UI** â†’ Too dependent on stable face recognition & mood detection. Drop for now.

### **Step 5 â€“ Competitive Edge Analysis**

What will make the judges remember us?

- Fast, no-lag demo (no crashing in front of them)
- At least **one AI-powered core feature** working live
- Simple, intuitive UI (donâ€™t get fancy, get clean)
- Bonus: Visuals/charts that update instantly in demo
