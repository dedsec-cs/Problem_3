# **Phase 1 – Extraction**

**Goal:** Decode the problem & lock the scope.
- Break the PDF into plain-English objectives.
- Identify **Core** vs **Optional** use cases.
- Map all actors, triggers, and outcomes.
- List all required data sources/APIs.
- Clarify all doubts with mentors before moving forward.
- Output: A 1-page “Problem Brief” everyone can understand.

# **Phase 2 – Deep Analysis**

**Goal:** Turn raw requirements into actionable insights.

- Analyze each use case: pain points + success metrics.
- Identify dependencies between features (what must be built first).
- Check feasibility vs time — kill anything that risks deadline.
- Research existing solutions for inspiration (steal ideas smartly, don’t reinvent).
- Define how we’ll measure “done” for each feature.
- Output: A prioritized features & risks list.

---

# **Phase 3 – Tech Blueprint**

**Goal:** Design the brain & skeleton of the product.

- Decide **frontend**, **backend**, **database**, and **integration tools** (keep it tech we know, not tech we wanna learn here).
- Draft the **system architecture** — diagrams of how data flows.
- Define API contracts & DB schema early.
- Assign team roles **based on skill ceiling** (so no one works on what they can’t handle).
- Output: A one-page “Tech Sheet” + architecture diagram.

# **Phase 4 – MVP Plan**

**Goal:** Build the smallest product that works and looks complete.

- Select **must-have features** for MVP.
- Create **day-by-day, hour-by-hour** build plan.
- Ensure everyone can work in parallel without stepping on each other’s code.
- Keep UI minimal but functional (judges hate half-finished fancy designs).
- Output: A working MVP by 70% of hackathon time — rest for polish.

---

# **Phase 5 – Final Strategy**

**Goal:** Make the MVP judge-ready & memorable.

- Add small **wow-factor** features (animations, data viz, AI touches, etc.).
- Polish UI & fix all obvious bugs.
- Prepare **demo script** — who speaks, who clicks, timing for each part.
- Create slides: Problem → Solution → Demo → Impact → Future scope.
- Rehearse demo at least twice before submission.
- Output: A confident, clean, and **uncrashable** demo.

💡 **Rule of Hackathon Survival**:  
We’re not here to build a startup. We’re here to deliver a functional, impressive prototype in insane time. Overbuilding is suicide — our win is in smart scope control.
