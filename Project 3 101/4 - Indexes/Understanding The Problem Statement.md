## Understanding the Problem Statement – AI-Powered Smart Survey Tool

### **1. Plain-English Restatement**

We’re building an **AI-powered, multilingual, multi-channel survey platform** for the Government of India’s Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI).  
It replaces slow, manual, enumerator-led surveys with a **smart, automated, adaptive system** that works on WhatsApp, phone calls, web, mobile, and even AI avatars — capable of:

- Asking the right questions (adaptively).
- Understanding multiple languages & voice.
- Pre-filling known data.
- Validating answers instantly.
- Storing and analyzing responses in a secure, structured way.

---

### **2. Core Objective**

- **Modernize official surveys** to handle India’s linguistic diversity and logistical complexity.
- Make surveys **faster, more accurate, more inclusive**, and ready for **large-scale national data collection**.
- Support **real-time quality control** and supervisor monitoring.

---

### **3. Why This Matters**

- Current surveys are **slow, costly, and error-prone**.
- India needs **scalable, tech-powered survey infrastructure** to handle socio-economic data efficiently.
- This is foundational for **"Statistics-as-a-Service" (StaaS)**, feeding into **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**.

---

### **4. Main Users (Actors)**

- **Respondents**: Citizens, households, or businesses providing data.
- **Enumerators**: Field surveyors collecting responses.
- **Supervisors/Admins**: Oversee quality, progress, and enumerator performance.
- **System (AI/Backend)**: Manages adaptive questioning, data validation, and secure storage.

---

### **5. Key Triggers**

- Survey invitation sent (via WhatsApp, call, avatar, or web link).
- Enumerator starts a survey session.
- Unique ID match found → pre-fill known info.
- AI detects inconsistent or suspicious data → triggers quality flag.

---

### **6. Expected Outcomes**

By the end of the hackathon, the solution should:

1. Deliver a **working prototype** (web/mobile/hybrid).
2. Include a **no-code survey builder**.
3. Work across **multiple channels** (WhatsApp, IVR, avatar chat).
4. Support **multilingual text and voice**.
5. Provide **real-time validation** and **auto-coding**.
6. Capture **paradata** (location, time, device, enumerator behavior).
7. Include a **monitoring dashboard**.
8. Ensure **data privacy & consent compliance**.

---

### **7. Built-in Constraints**

- **Must handle multiple languages** automatically.
- **Must be secure** (data encryption, privacy by design).
- **Must be adaptable** for future surveys and datasets.
- **Must run reliably** in low-connectivity or offline mode (bonus).

### **8. Immediate Clarification Questions for Mentors**

1. **Deployment Environment** – Is government hosting mandatory or can we use cloud?
2. **Integration** – Are we expected to integrate with existing MoSPI systems (e.g., LGD codes)?
3. **Data Sources** – Will access to Aadhaar/phone mapping be provided for prepopulation, or must we simulate it?
4. **WhatsApp API** – Will we get sandbox access, or should we mock the integration?
5. **Offline Mode** – Is it required for MVP or only future scope?
6. **Voice Interface** – Should it be fully functional or prototype-level only?
7. **AI Component** – Can we use external LLM APIs or must it be locally hosted for data security?
