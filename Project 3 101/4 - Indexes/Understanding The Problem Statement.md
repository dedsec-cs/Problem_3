Our objective is simple: **deliver a solution that is practical, efficient, and impactful** — while ensuring it’s backed by strong technical reasoning and clear execution planning.

To make sure we address every part of the problem systematically, we’ve broken down our journey into **five core phases**:

1. **Extraction** – Understanding the problem deeply and collecting every relevant piece of data, requirement, and constraint.
2. **Deep Analysis** – Studying the collected inputs, identifying pain points, and mapping them to possible solution directions.
3. **Tech Blueprint** – Designing a solid technical architecture and technology stack that ensures scalability and feasibility.
4. **MVP Plan** – Prioritizing features to create a Minimum Viable Product that delivers maximum value in the least time.
5. **Final Strategy** – Refining the solution with presentation, UI/UX, and value-adding elements that will help us stand out in front of the judges.

Our mission in this hackathon is to **not just solve the problem, but solve it smartly** — using structured thinking, optimized teamwork, and practical engineering choices.
